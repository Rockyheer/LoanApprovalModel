# Loan Approval Prediction

This repo contains the Loan Approval Prediction project as part of my data science portfolio the model has also been deployed using heroku. The dataset used had over 12 features which were taken into consideration while making the deep learning model and the model was made with ANN.

This project covers the whole process from feature engineering the data to deploying the DL model on a cloud platform using Django:


1. Data Collection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Pre-processing
4. Model Development and Evaluation
5. Integrating with Django
6. Deploying on heroku
