# Loan Approval Prediction
Loan Approval Prediction in Python

In this project, we have used various EDA techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict the chances of loan approval using sci-kit libraries from python.

This project covers the complete process from data collection to deploying modelling and evaluation:

1. Data Collection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Pre-processing
4. Model Development and Evaluation
